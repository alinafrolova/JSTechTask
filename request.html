                    As a high school student, you should place the Education section at the beginning of your resume, even if you already have work experience.
                    Beyond that, your resumeâ€™s format and content will depend upon how much work experience you have, and how active you are as a student in high school.

            <h4>Working Professional</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Name of School</li>
                    <li>School Location</li>
                    <li>Type of Degree/Field of Study</li>
                    <li>Graduation Year</li>
